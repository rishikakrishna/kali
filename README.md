  Kali is a web app designed to connect students looking for a workout plan with student-athletes' regimen. Unfortunately, doing so via the web usually ends up losing a love of the support and motivation one would get from a friend or trainer. Kali however, focusses on that aspect the most. By creating virtual trainers versions of real student-athletes, we not only tap the reliable and expansive knowledge of these people but also bring a friendlier, more relateable guidance. You will notice to that Kali also makes it very easy to connect even more with your favorite trainers, as it links to all of their social media and even sends out alerts when trainers' are performing.
  To get started, students will create an account and choose of focus of their workout regimen. Kali then will suggest some athletes that have great workouts for that focus. The student can look through the athletes' profiles and get a sense of who they are, what they do, and if their workouts are right for them. Once a workout is selected, the trainer will introduce the workout and begin, explaining exercises and offering their personal tips as they go. The student controls the pace of the workout, and, when finished, can favorite the workout or trainer and earn achievements all of which is kept on their personal profile. The big draw for the athletes here is when a student favorites a trainer. In doing so they get a feed of updates and events from that trainer so they can keep up with the trainer's athleticism and personal goals, finding motivation outside of the gym as well as in.
